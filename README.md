# Movie Recommendation System and Interface
This project includes a movie recommendation system developed in the Python programming language and the Streamlit application that transforms this system into a user-friendly interface.

# About the project
- In this project, a movie recommendation system was created using various Python libraries. As a result of the analysis made on the data sets, movie recommendations are offered according to the interests of the users. The recommendation system analyzes user preferences using data mining and machine learning techniques and makes recommendations with similar user profiles.

- Later, this recommendation system was converted into an interface using the Streamlit library. Users can get movie recommendations, filter and get detailed information about the recommended movies through a simple web interface.
