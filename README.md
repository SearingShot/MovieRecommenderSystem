# Movie Recommendation System and Interface
This project includes a movie recommendation system developed in the Python programming language and the Streamlit application that transforms this system into a user-friendly interface.

# About the project
- In this project, a movie recommendation system was created using various Python libraries. It Uses Machine Learning's Nearest Neighbours Techniques, to find recommendation for users using cosine similarity function.
  
- Later, this recommendation system was converted into an interface using the Streamlit library. Users can get movie recommendations through a simple web interface.
