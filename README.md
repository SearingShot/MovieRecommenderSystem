# Movie Recommendation System and Interface
This project includes a movie recommendation system developed using Python and the Streamlit Module that transforms this system into a user-friendly interface.

# About the project
- In this project, a movie recommendation system was created using various Python libraries. It Uses Machine Learning's Nearest Neighbours Techniques, to find recommendation for users using cosine similarity function.
  
- Later, this recommendation system was converted into an interface using the Streamlit library. Users can get movie recommendations through a simple User interface.

# Technologies and Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Countvectorizer

All requirements are listed in requirements.txt file

# Dataset
Dataset used are as follows :-
- [tmdb_5000_credits.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wBzOwx4eJLhYwAaugoR4AhXiVZvBt4ek/view?usp=drive_link)
- [tmdb_5000_movies.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13WSIZfjMFFZk6pPKH6u4l9BxMzql73A_/view?usp=drive_link)

# Points To Note
- In case, you do not wish to use pickle library to take the variables from jupyter notebook and import them in site.py, use app.py as it is the merged version of site.py and jupyter notebook.

# Conclusion
- User Interface for the movie recommendation system would look like this :-
